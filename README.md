# Game Overview
<br>

## Working Title
- Dungeon Bosses

<br>
<br>

## Elevator Pitch (Changed Completely)
- Players will need to adapt to different gameplay styles on the fly throughout their progress in the game. For example, the player will traverse a dungeon in a rougue hack n slash style of gameplay and then when they reach the final boss of the dungeon the fight become a turnbased rpg style. Another example would be the player travels through a gauntlet of enemies in a galaga style of gameplay and then the final boss would be similar to a mega man boss. Truly a game with multiple callbacks to various retro gameplay styles

(1 level of the 3 originally planned were made due to time constraints)

## Concept Overview

#### - Genre: 
- dungeon crawler, rpg, etc.
#### - Target Audience: 
- anybody looking to kill time
#### - Platform & System Requirements:
- Windows Operating System for the game build
- Web build version (if there is extra time to look into)
- Godot Game Enigne for Development
#### - Theme and Setting:
- Each "Dugeon" can have its own style (discussed with team)
- Gameplay would probably be level selection oriented from a ui menu or the player picks a door to go through in a hub world.
- Player is a type of traveller that corrects worlds that have gone too far down the wrong path

<br>

## Locations
  - Inspirations from the team
  - In game locales will be based off of these inspirations
  - (This should ensure people on the team are interesested to work on at least a portion of the game)

<br>
<br>

## Story (scratched - had to remove due to time constraints on everyones schedules)
  - I would like to keep it as simple and vague as possible
  - since the plan is for 3 full levels with dugeon and boss in each, im thinking of having story beats sprinkled at certain sections where gameplay is at a minimum.
  #### Locations where story should be told:
  - (intro before the player does anything) 
  - (some excerpt of info on a world at each door in the hub when a player is choosing to go through a door)
  - (some dialouge or explanation of what needs to be done at the beginning of a dugeon)
  - (before or after a boss fight in a dugeon)
  - (after the player comes back from a dugeon to the hub world)

<br>
<br>

## Characters (scratched)
  - The Player
  - The player will have a companion that will explain things to the player (dont know what form it will take yet)
  - Each Boss will be considered a character since they will have dialouge lines
  - Maybe an npc for shop items (if needed)

<br>
<br>

## Gameplay/Mechanics
  - PlayerController (needed for every gameplay style)
  - AI Controller (one specific for every boss and enemies)
  - Object Specs (interactions, collsions, etc.)

<br>
<br>

## Levels
  - Tutorial Area / World Hub (scratched)
  - Level 1 / First Dungeon
    - Side scroller gameplay, player will have a shotgun 
    - Boss room at the end of the level.
  - Level 2 / Second Dungeon (scratched)
  - Level 3 / Third Dungeon  (scratched)
  - Anything else can decided at a later date. 

<br>
<br>

## assets
  - Art, at the artist's direction, will decide on specs so that everyone can work with expectations on asset specs in mind.
  - Sound, would be prefered if 1 person worked on this entirely, if not then sound design will be left for last on priority list.
