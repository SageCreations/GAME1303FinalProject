# The Final Project Proposal for GAME 1303/1304


# Game Overview

## Working Title
- Dungeon Bosses

## Elevator Pitch
- Players will need to adapt to different gameplay styles on the fly throughout their progress in the game. For example, the player will traverse a dungeon in a rougue hackNslash style of gameplay and then when they reach the final boss of the dungeon the fight become a turnbased rpg style. Another example would be the player travels through a gauntlet of enemies in a galaga style of gameplay and then the final boss would be similar to a mega man boss. Truly a game with multiple callbacks to various retro gameplay styles

## Concept
### Overview

#### - Genre: *dungeon crawler, rpg*
#### - Target Audience: *anybody looking to kill time*
#### - Platform & System Requirements:
  - Windows Operating System
  - Unity Game Engine version 2020.x.xf(LTS)
### Theme and Setting
  - Each "Dugeon" can have its own style
  - gameplay would probably be level selection oriented from a ui a menu or the player picks a door to go through in a hub world.
  - 

## Project Scope
### Our Team
- Programmer: Edward Cruz
- Design: placeholder
- Art: placeholder
- QA: placeholder

## Locations
  - Inspirations from the team
  - In game locales will be based off of these inspirations
  - (This should ensure people on the team are interesested to work on at least a portion of the game)
## Story
  - I would like to keep it as simple and vague as possible
  - since the plan is for 3 full levels with dugeon and boss in each, im thinking of having story beats sprinkled at certain sections where gameplay is at a minimum.
  ### Locations where story should be told
  - (intro before the player does anything) 
  - (some excerpt of info on a world at each door in the hub when a player is choosing to go through a door)
  - (some dialouge or explanation of what needs to be done at the beginning of a dugeon)
  - (before or after a boss fight in a dugeon)
  - (after the player comes back from a dugeon to the hub world)
## Characters
  - The Player
  - The player will have a companion that will explain things to the player (dont know what form it will take yet)
  - Each Boss will be considered a character since they will have dialouge lines
  - Maybe an npc for shop items (if needed)
